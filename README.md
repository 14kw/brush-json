# brush-json

Json brush module for [SyntaxHighlighter](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter).

JSON is included in brush-javascript.
However, I do not like syntax, so I will create it separately.

## Usage

Please see [Building Instructions](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter/wiki/Building) on the [SyntaxHighlighter Wiki](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter/syntaxhighlighter/wiki) for details.
